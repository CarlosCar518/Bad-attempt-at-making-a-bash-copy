--Full inline editing added. Now its no only visual, the buffer changes too. I have not found bugs yet.

--Improved a lot the stetic of the console, now kind of looks like a serious console.

--Fixed some bugs related to some commands

--Fully implemented windows virtual console https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/console-virtual-terminal-sequences. It is much better than the regular console. This gave me a lot of flexibility to personalize the console and move the cursor around the console.

--THE SNAKE GAME NOW WORKS. It is playable now and the snake grows. I have to create an UI and reduce the playable space.
